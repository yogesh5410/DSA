# 🚀 CP+DSA Consistency Tracker

A personal repository to track my daily competitive programming and data structures & algorithms practice journey.

## 📋 About

This repository serves as a consistency tracker for my CP+DSA learning journey. I'm committed to solving problems daily to build strong problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## 🎯 Daily Goals

- **CP-31 Problem**: One problem from the CP-31 sheet daily
- **LeetCode POTD**: LeetCode Problem of the Day
- **Bonus Practice**: Additional problems when time permits
